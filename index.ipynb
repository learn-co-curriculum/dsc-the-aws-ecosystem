    "Before we can begin exploring everything AWS has to offer, we'll need to create an account on the platform. To do this, start by following this link to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). While you're there, you may want to take the time to bookmark it -- chances are this is a website you'll use frequently in your career as a data scientist!\n",

    "\n",
    "Although you will need a credit card to register for AWS, working through this section will not cost any money. AWS provides a free tier for learning and prototyping on the platform -- this is the tier we'll use for everything going forward. As long as you correctly register for the free tier, this will not cost you any money. \n",

    "\n",
    "Begin by clicking the \"Sign Up\" button in the top right-hand corner of the page. \n",

Although we will only be making use of the free tier of services for AWS, be aware that you will still need to enter a credit card number in order to complete the registration process. \n",

    "### AWS Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS has data centers all over the world, and they are **not** interchangeable when it comes to your projects. Check out [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) to see a list of all of the current AWS regions across the globe. While it typically won't matter for your projects in this program, the different AWS regions vary in terms of latency, cost, legal compliance, and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AWS region is a separate geographic area and is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions. This helps achieve the greatest possible fault-tolerance and stability. Communication between regions is possible, but often costs money and/or requires additional security configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Your Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "It is **_very important_** that you always choose the same region to connect to with your projects. Resources are not automatically replicated across regions! One of the most common mistakes newcomers to AWS make is thinking they've lost their project because they are connected to a different data center and don't realize it. We'll remind you of this again later, but it can't hurt to say it twice: always make sure you're connected to the correct data center! This goes doubly for when you're creating a new project. "

    "## AWS IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM stands for [Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). AWS allows IT administrators to configure access to different services at a very granular level, which can get intimidating pretty quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially all you need to know is that access to services requires you to create a **role** in IAM, and then set a **policy** for that role's access permissions. In some cases, e.g. you want to run a cloud notebook in [AWS SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam.html), that role should be restricted to just you, and you should have permission to take any action. In other cases, e.g. you want to store data in an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-overview.html), you might want to allow anyone to download the data, but only allow yourself to upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our curriculum examples we'll advise on IAM settings, but you'll likely need to do your own research as you explore beyond these for your own projects. Luckily these are public projects so the risk of leaking data or models is low. In a job setting, make sure you consult with your IT team to make sure that you are not revealing private data."

While AWS is great for basic use cases like hosting a server or a website, it also has all kinds of different offerings in areas such as Databases, Machine Learning, Data Analytics and other areas useful to Data Scientists.\n",

    "It's not possible for us to cover how to use every service in AWS in this section -- but luckily, we don't need to, because Amazon already has!

We **_strongly recommend_** bookmarking this page, as the tutorials they offer are very high quality, and free!\n",
